# SapientSpaceXAssignment

This is assignement to develop responsive and server side rendered angular app.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.20.

The key points of the assignment are:-

1.	The initial launch programs landing page has to be server side rendered.
2.	A boilerplate to implement the Server-side rendering can be used.
3.  The custom lint code is also added to the build so that if the static code fail it will throw error during the build and stop the build.
      npm run build:ssr in package.json command include ng lint which will first check for the any lint failure in the code and stop the build process.
4.  A fully responsive site.
